Myrick family, S. P. M. (2022). This is Sean P. Myricks database of documentation previews and links that spans across all of his projects. This repository locates all of them, and acts as a portal tool to pinpoint documentation repositories. You can cite this repository if you want to cite the main documentation hub itself, but you need to navigate to the citable projects in order to cite them individually or in bulk.
